description: Manage Typix extensions from your terminal with the Typix CLI
---

The Typix CLI (`@typix-editor/cli`) is the fastest way to manage extensions in your project.
Instead of looking up package names, running installs manually, or diagnosing config issues yourself — the CLI handles it all in a single command.

## Installation

<Tabs items={["npx (no install)", "pnpm", "npm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="npx (no install)">
    ```bash
    npx @typix-editor/cli <command>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add -g @typix-editor/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @typix-editor/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add @typix-editor/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add -g @typix-editor/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  The CLI automatically detects your package manager (`pnpm`, `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun`) by scanning for lockfiles — starting from your current directory and walking up to the project root. You never need to specify it manually.
</Callout>

## Commands overview

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`typix init`](#init) | Set up a `typix.json` config in your project |
| [`typix add`](#add) | Add one or more extensions |
| [`typix upgrade`](#upgrade) | Upgrade installed extensions to their latest versions |
| [`typix remove`](#remove) | Remove extensions from your project |
| [`typix list`](#list) | Show all available extensions |
| [`typix doctor`](#doctor) | Diagnose common issues in your Typix project |
| [`typix env`](#env) | Print environment and installed package info |

---

## init

Initializes Typix in your project by creating a `typix.json` config file. Run this once when setting up a new project.

```bash
typix init
```

You will be prompted for:

| Prompt | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Component output directory | `components/typix` | Where generated component files will be placed |
| Use TypeScript? | `yes` | Enables `.tsx` output |
| Use Tailwind CSS? | `yes` | Adds Tailwind class names to generated components |
| Package manager | auto-detected | Which package manager to use for installs |

The result is a `typix.json` at your project root:

```json title="typix.json"
{
  "componentDir": "components/typix",
  "typescript": true,
  "tailwind": true,
  "packageManager": "pnpm"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  If a `typix.json` already exists, the CLI will ask before overwriting it.
</Callout>

---

## add

Installs one or more extensions into your project. The CLI resolves the correct package name automatically — you only need to use the short extension name.

```bash
typix add [extensions...] [--all]
```

**Interactive mode** — run with no arguments to get a searchable multi-select picker:

```bash
typix add
```

**Install specific extensions** — pass one or more names directly:

```bash
typix add link floating-link short-cuts
```

**Install everything** — add every available extension at once:

```bash
typix add --all
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-a, --all` | Install all available extensions |

<Callout type="warn">
  Extension names are short identifiers (e.g. `link`, `mention`), not the full npm package names. Run `typix list` to see all valid names.
</Callout>

---

## upgrade

Upgrades installed Typix extensions to their latest published versions.

```bash
typix upgrade [extensions...] [--all]
```

**Interactive mode** — shows only your currently installed extensions:

```bash
typix upgrade
```

**Upgrade specific extensions:**

```bash
typix upgrade link mention
```

**Upgrade all installed extensions at once:**

```bash
typix upgrade --all
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-a, --all` | Upgrade all installed extensions |

<Callout type="info">
  Only extensions that are already installed in your project will appear in interactive mode. Extensions not found in your `package.json` are skipped with a warning.
</Callout>

---

## remove

Uninstalls Typix extensions from your project and removes them from `package.json`.

```bash
typix remove [extensions...] [--all]
```

**Interactive mode** — pick from your installed extensions:

```bash
typix remove
```

**Remove specific extensions:**

```bash
typix remove collapsible drag-drop-paste
```

**Remove everything** — uninstalls all installed Typix extensions:

```bash
typix remove --all
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-a, --all` | Remove all installed extensions (requires confirmation) |

<Callout type="warn">
  All removal operations require a confirmation prompt before any packages are uninstalled. The `--all` flag asks for an explicit `yes` before proceeding.
</Callout>

---

## list

Prints a formatted table of every available extension — name, package, and description.

```bash
typix list
```

Example output:

```
Available extensions:

  Name                    Package                                         Description
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  auto-complete           @typix-editor/extension-auto-complete           Autocomplete suggestions as you type
  auto-link               @typix-editor/extension-auto-link               Automatically detect and convert URLs to links
  code-highlight-prism    @typix-editor/extension-code-highlight-prism    Syntax highlighting with Prism.js
  ...
```

---

## doctor

Runs a health check on your project and reports any issues it finds.

```bash
typix doctor
```

The following checks are performed:

| Check | What it verifies |
| --- | --- |
| `typix.json` config | Config file exists in the project root |
| `package.json` | A `package.json` is readable from the working directory |
| `@typix-editor/react` | The core Typix package is installed |
| `lexical` peer dependency | The required `lexical` peer dep is present |
| Extension validity | All installed `@typix-editor/extension-*` packages are known extensions |

Example output when everything is healthy:

```
Running Typix diagnostics...

  ✔ typix.json config found
  ✔ package.json found
  ✔ @typix-editor/react is installed
  ✔ lexical peer dependency is installed
  ✔ All installed extensions are valid

✔ All checks passed. Your Typix project looks healthy!
```

When issues are found, each failing check includes a fix hint:

```
  ✖ lexical peer dependency is installed
    → Run pnpm add lexical to install the required peer dependency.
```

<Callout type="info">
  Run `typix doctor` whenever something feels off — missing config, broken installs, or peer dependency warnings. It's a fast first step before digging deeper.
</Callout>

---

## env

Prints system information and a list of all currently installed Typix extensions with their resolved versions. Useful for bug reports and debugging.

```bash
typix env
```

Example output:

```
